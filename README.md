# OpenSSL 1.0.2u for Windows 98

I looked for a prebuilt binary for this all over the internet, couldn't find one, so made my own. Should save you from having to install VC++2005 to compile it.
Yes, I downloaded Visual Studio 2005 just for compiling openssl.

Was last released 2019, so should support TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. SSL 3 has been disabled (configured with no-ssl3), if you really want SSL 3 why not
just use an old build of OpenSSL from back when Windows 98 was supported?
